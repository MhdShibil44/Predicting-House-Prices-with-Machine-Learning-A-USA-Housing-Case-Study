## 🔍 Workflow Summary  

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration  
- Imported and inspected the dataset using *pandas*.  
- Verified data structure and consistency using .info() and .describe().

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized distributions using *displots* and *boxplots*.  
- Explored relationships and correlations among features using *pairplots* and *heatmaps*.

### 3️⃣ Custom Statistical Summary  
- Utilized a self-developed Python module — Basic_Stats — for deeper data insights.  
- Calculated *mean, **median, **standard deviation*, and other descriptive metrics for all numerical fields.

### 4️⃣ Feature Preparation  
- Isolated target (Price) and predictor variables.  
- Performed an *80–20 train-test split* to ensure fair evaluation.

### 5️⃣ Model Training  
- Implemented a *Linear Regression model* using scikit-learn.  
- Extracted *coefficients* and *intercept* to understand the impact of each feature.

### 6️⃣ Model Evaluation & Prediction  
- Predicted prices on *test data*.  
- Evaluated model performance using:  
  - *Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)*  
  - *R² Score*
